  <h3>Valorant Tips For Myself</h3>

  <p>It seems so far in Valorant that moving is more OP than I realized, strafing fast and slowing down to walk shoot is probably the best way for mid to short range currently.
    On top of that pre-firing seems to be a good move for me especially when my reactions are slow but my anticipation is high.</p>

  <h3>Current Style</h3>

  <p> Vandal Preferred, although Phantom feels good and I could switch over to it at some point!
    I always aim for 3900 next round, my eco rounds usually consist of light armor + whatever weapon keeps me at 3900 next.</p>
